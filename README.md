# flask-boilerplate
Minimal setup for building a Python API running with Flask and MongoDB, inside Docker Containers. Some more info can be found in [this medium post](https://medium.com/@gabimelo/developing-a-flask-api-in-a-docker-container-with-uwsgi-and-nginx-e089e43ed90e).

The Makefile contains all commands required for locally running and testing the system. Run them like, for example, `make dev-up`.
